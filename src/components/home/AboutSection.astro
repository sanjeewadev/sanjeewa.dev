      <p>
        Hi, I’m Sanjeewa. I am a software engineering student and web developer who understands business. 
        I help small businesses and personal brands build fast, reliable websites that bring in real customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many developers just write code. I focus on the result. I don’t believe in overcomplicated systems or expensive monthly fees. 
        My goal is to build you a clean, mobile-friendly site that you actually own.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work directly with you—no middlemen, no confusion. You get a professional website delivered in 5-7 days, 
        optimized for Google and ready to grow your business.
      </p>
