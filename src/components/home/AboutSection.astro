      <p>
        Hi, I’m Sanjeewa. I help small businesses and personal brands build fast,
        reliable websites that are easy to manage and focused on real results.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t believe in overcomplicated systems or bloated websites. My goal is
        simple: build clean, mobile-friendly sites that load fast, look
        professional, and help you get inquiries.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work directly with clients, keep communication clear, and deliver
        projects on time — without unnecessary technical confusion.
